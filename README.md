MURP GIS Fall 2020
I am interested in exploring the theme of extreme climate events in correlation to human migration, and/or it's socio-economic impact on housing. 
My objectives are the following:
  1. Learn where to find and how to clean data from different data related to my topics of interest. 
  2. How to use this data to create theme maps, and or other ways of visualizing the information in an accessible, creative and clear manner.
