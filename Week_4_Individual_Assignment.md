# Keynote presentation with Ben Welsh from The Los Angeles Times
I enjoyed listening to Ben Welsch's presentation about the innovative and data driven journalism that his team has been working on for the last years. One of the most significant takeaways from his presentation was how providing data analysis in the context of an individual’s story can profoundly affect the way that readers understand a certain problem and its scale. Moreover, the L.A Times team has instant access to these data records to use instantly in future stories in which this data may be relevant, thus creating its own journalism data archive. Welsh provided several examples in which having algorithms readily available have allowed the almost immediate and ongoing publication of breaking stories such as the documentation of police murders, Covid 19 cases and wildfire alerts. For all of these stories, a combination of graphic design, data analysis and storytelling skills have been used, which highlights the benefits of understanding data exploration methods in order to present ideas, stories and relevant analysis for any topic. 
In addition, I learned some a new term “scrollingtelling”. I understand this to be the new era of newspapers and news-consumption considering that not a lot of people read the physical paper anymore. It feels necessary to reinvent this and other forms of communication, in order to make them more appealing, faster to read, engaging and with an interactive design. 
Lastly, I appreciated that Welsch gave credit to his team and made clear what are the stages and the need of a combination of talents and skills in order to produce these stories. Team work is key.
