I read the Article Global trends toward urban street-network sprawl - co-authored by Professor Adam Millard-Ball and published in October of last year. 

This was my first time hearing about the street-network disconnectedness index -SNDi.  I also find it amazing that OMS has managed to capture global data at such a scale, and although it is not complete by any means, it does allow for a wide array of research interests and scopes. According to the authors, it is surprising that although there are more streets being developed around the world, “connectivity” is not increasing.  In the meantime, the authors explain that emission reductions in the transportation sector are not going down as significantly as other polluting sources, which is why they focused on one important decision-making factor for car use such as limited connectivity.  

It would be interesting to know who are some of the key decision makers in the cities and countries mentioned in the article. For example, the authors pointed out violence as one of the variables that defines the development of less connected streets in Central America, as well as the expanding middle class in other developing countries, which has a desire for more exclusive and less accessible residential areas. I am also curious about how connected or disconnected are informal settlements in some of the countries mentioned such as Brazil and India given that people sometimes build roads to get to their place of residence in an organic manner, many of them not paved.  With the increase of climate change effects in the built environment, I wonder what other way can streets be shaped to allow for faster evacuation, water damage prevention in flood-prone areas, or to accommodate green infrastructure. 

Questions
- Is there a balance or decrease in the index score when disconnected street developments that are connected by a pedestrian or bicycle path?
- What international collaborations has he built while doing this research? Has he applied any qualitative research methods, such as interviews or surveys to support the conclusions in relation to high or increasing street connectivity in “low” and “middle-income” countries?
